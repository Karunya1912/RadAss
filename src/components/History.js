        Founded in 1896 by a group of visionary healthcare professionals, our hospital began as a modest community clinic dedicated to providing accessible, high-quality medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1990, recognizing the need for expansion to better serve our patients, the hospital underwent a significant transformation. We moved to a larger, state-of-the-art facility, enabling us to offer a broader range of services and advanced medical treatments. This milestone was marked by the introduction of specialized departments, including cardiology,   attracting highly skilled medical professionals and specialists to our team.
        </p>
        <p>
        Today, our hospital stands as a beacon of excellence in healthcare, known for our compassionate care, cutting-edge technology, and commitment to patient well-being. With a team of dedicated professionals and a legacy of innovation, we continue to strive for excellence in all aspects of healthcare delivery. Our journey from a small community clinic to a leading healthcare institution is a testament to our unwavering dedication to improving the health and lives of our patients.
